Restart Druid cluster
Once the Hadoop .xml files have been copied to the Druid cluster and 
the segment/log storage configuration has been updated to use HDFS, 
the Druid cluster needs to be restarted for the new configurations to take effect.

If the cluster is still running, CTRL-C to terminate the bin/start-micro-quickstart script, 
and re-run it to bring the Druid services back up.
