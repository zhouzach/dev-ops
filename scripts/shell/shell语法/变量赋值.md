Examples
variable doesn't exist
$ echo "$VAR1"

$ VAR1="${VAR1:-default value}"
$ echo "$VAR1"
default value
variable exists
$ VAR1="has value"
$ echo "$VAR1"
has value

$ VAR1="${VAR1:-default value}"
$ echo "$VAR1"
has value
The same thing can be done by evaluating other variables, or running commands within the default value portion of the notation.

$ VAR2="has another value"
$ echo "$VAR2"
has another value
$ echo "$VAR1"

$

$ VAR1="${VAR1:-$VAR2}"
$ echo "$VAR1"
has another value
More Examples
You can also use a slightly different notation where it's just VARX=${VARX-<def. value>}.

$ echo "${VAR1-0}"
has another value
$ echo "${VAR2-0}"
has another value
$ echo "${VAR3-0}"
0
In the above $VAR1 & $VAR2 were already defined with the string "has another value" but $VAR3 was undefined, so the default value was used instead, 0.

Another Example
$ VARX="${VAR3-0}"
$ echo "$VARX"
0
Checking and assigning using := notation
Lastly I'll mention the handy operator, :=. This will do a check and assign a value if the variable under test is empty or undefined.

Example
Notice that $VAR1 is now set. The operator := did the test and the assignment in a single operation.

$ unset VAR1
$ echo "$VAR1"

$ echo "${VAR1:=default}"
default
$ echo "$VAR1"
default
However if the value is set prior, then it's left alone.

$ VAR1="some value"
$ echo "${VAR1:=default}"
some value
$ echo "$VAR1"
some value
