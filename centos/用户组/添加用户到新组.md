to add the user john to the docker group:
sudo usermod -a -G docker john 


usermod is a command that modifies the system configuration for a specific user ($USER in our example – see below). See the manpage documentation for more details on what you can do with it!
-a is a shortcut for --append: It means append the group to the list of groups the user belongs to!
-G is a shortcut for --groups: It tells usermod that the next argument is a group. Note that you need to use a capital -G here because we don’t want to modify the user’s primary group but the list of supplemental groups the user belongs to.
docker is the group we want to add $USER to. This could be any Linux group, provided that it exists. Use less /etc/group to have a look at all the groups that exist!



1.查看当前用户所属用户组

[oracle@serverhl ~]$ groups
oinstall dba
2.查看<user1>, <user2> 和 <user3>所属的组

语法：

groups <user1> <user2> <user3>
例子：

[oracle@serverhl ~]$ groups root oracle
root : root
oracle : oinstall dba
